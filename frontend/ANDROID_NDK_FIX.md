# Android NDK Version Configuration

## Issue
The TrayTrail Flutter project was configured with Android NDK 26.3.11579264, but the `shared_preferences_android` plugin requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973. This version mismatch can cause build failures and compatibility issues.

## Solution
Updated the NDK version in `/android/app/build.gradle.kts` to use the highest required version:

```kotlin
android {
    namespace = "com.traytrail.tray_trail"
    compileSdk = flutter.compileSdkVersion
    ndkVersion = "27.0.12077973"  // Updated from flutter.ndkVersion
    
    // ... rest of configuration
}
```

## Why This Works
- Android NDK versions are backward compatible
- Using the highest required version (27.0.12077973) ensures compatibility with all plugins
- This resolves dependency conflicts without breaking existing functionality

## Affected Dependencies
- `shared_preferences_android`: Requires NDK 27.0.12077973
- Other plugins will work with this version due to backward compatibility

## Build Instructions
After making this change:

1. Clean the project: `flutter clean`
2. Get dependencies: `flutter pub get`
3. Build as normal: `flutter build apk` or `flutter run`

## Verification
The build system will now use Android NDK 27.0.12077973 for all native Android compilation, ensuring compatibility with all project dependencies.
