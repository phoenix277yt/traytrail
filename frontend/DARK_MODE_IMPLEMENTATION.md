# TrayTrail State Management Implementation - Dark Mode

## Current State

### Theme Configuration:
- **Single Theme**: App uses only the light theme with TrayTrail brand colors
- **Primary Color**: Champagne Pink (#F7E1D7)
- **Secondary Color**: Tomato (#FE7252) 
- **Tertiary Color**: Mint (#3AB795)
- **Background**: White (#FFFFFF) with champagne pink accents

### User Preferences:
- `isDarkMode` field retained for potential future use but not actively used
- `useSystemTheme` set to `false`
- Original TrayTrail color palette restored
- All dark mode specific fields removed

## Benefits of Current Implementation
1. **Simplified**: Single theme reduces complexity
2. **Brand Consistent**: Uses original TrayTrail color palette exclusively
3. **Performant**: No theme switching logic or dark theme assets
4. **Clean State Management**: Riverpod-based state management for user preferences
5. **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns with proper file organization

## Future Considerations
If dark mode is needed in the future:
- The `isDarkMode` field in `ThemePreferences` can be reactivated
- Dark color schemes can be re-added to theme files
- Theme switching logic can be implemented in `main.dart`
- The current architecture supports adding dark mode without major changes
