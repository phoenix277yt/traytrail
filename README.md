## 📱 About

TrayTrail is an elegant food tracking and menu management application that helps users discover, vote on, and manage food options. Built with Flutter using Material Design 3 principles, it offers a beautiful and intuitive user experience across all platforms.

## ✨ Features

- **🎨 Material Design 3**: Modern, adaptive UI with dynamic theming
- **🏠 Home Dashboard**: Quick actions and recent activity overview
- **🍽️ Menu Management**: Browse and manage food menus
- **🗳️ Polls & Voting**: Democratic food selection system
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on phones, tablets, and android based desktops.

## 📱 Platform Support

- ❌ **iOS** (iOS 12+ planned, but currently not supported)

> ℹ️ iOS support is planned but currently unavailable due to hardware limitations. The app builds successfully for iOS, but I cannot test or sign it without access to an Apple Developer Account and test device along with valid provisioning. If you'd like to help test or contribute an iOS build, feel free to reach out.
